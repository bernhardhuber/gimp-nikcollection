A small and nice Gimp plugin based on the ShellOut plugin.

The ShellOut plugin is able to invoke external applications from within Gimp and passing the current layer to these external applications.

This variant registers NikSoftware applications as external programs.

Thus you can use the NikSoftware filters from gimp, directly thanks to the ShellOut Gimp plugin, and some simple configurations.
